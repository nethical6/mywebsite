<h1>Aphasia</h1>
</center>

I am completely normal

I have the words in my head

But I just cant put them together when I speak ahead

So everyone thinks I'm abnormal instead

<br>

I stay completely silent

Cause no one really understands what I'm trying to say

I am Totally helpless in my in my lonely way

How should I convey

<br>

I am truly in pain

But still hoping to get okay

Very soon someday

So I can then again talk like the good old way

<br>

~ Nethical
